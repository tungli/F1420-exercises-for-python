# Subtitle syncronization

Sometimes subtitles are out of sync and can destroy a good movie-watching experience.
In this exercise, we will make a Python script that corrects the time stamps for the easy-to-read *srt* file.

In this exercise you will practice:

* working with basic Python data types such as lists, dicts, strings
* working with text files
* writing simple functions


The *srt* file format specifications are provided [here](https://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html).
When you look at the format, notice that the third field, namely the subtitle itself, can contain more than one line.
