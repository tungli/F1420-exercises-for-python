1
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,639
(Rain pattering)

2
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,039
I'm afraid you have to decide right now
if you want to be registered

3
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,999
as a homosexual or a heterosexual.

4
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,199
I think I should be registered
as a heterosexual.

5
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,399
OK, I would like you to write your name
clearly on this form in capital letters.

6
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,679
"Thank God they wear those
waterproof ponchos," he thought.

7
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,479
- Yes, a lobster.
- Why a lobster?

8
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,439
Because lobsters live
for over 100 years,

9
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,279
I water-ski and swim quite well,
since I was a teenager.

10
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,319
A lobster is an excellent choice.

11
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,399
Later on he would learn
that she often got nosebleeds.

12
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,959
He thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee,

13
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,199
A woman who seemed to like
butter biscuits

14
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,719
who he would later find out
was absolutely heartless.

15
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,519
who was better at math than she was.

16
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,359
My mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turned into a wolf.

17
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,919
One day,
I decided to enter the enclosure

18
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,479
which is also my defining characteristic.

19
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,559
My defining characteristic
is that I have a very beautiful smile.

20
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,079
She's the best hunter in the hotel,
silent and very fast.

21
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,199
One way is to rinse the clothes
with cold water then rub with sea salt.

22
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,599
The third way is to mix flour and water
into a paste, like toothpaste,

23
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,879
But just never use warm water
on blood, ever.

24
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,679
Well, let me know when
you feel better and we can dance again.

25
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,839
(Coughs and splutters.)

26
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,599
How many darts did you use yesterday?

27
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,839
(Coughs and splutters)

28
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,679
- This is not necessary.
- Please place your hand in the toaster.

29
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,479
What they do,
as soon as you enter the room,

30
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,399
My uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there.

31
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,439
No waiters know about the procedure,

32
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,159
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap.

33
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,839
Afterwards, they remove the heart,
the eyes and other vital organs of the body

34
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
Afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts

35
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,079
- New guests arrived yesterday.
- Yes, I saw.

36
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,599
WOMAN: One night on the coach, he sat next
to the woman who liked butter biscuits.

37
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,559
I'd give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.

38
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,959
Some excuses are without doubt
better than others.

39
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,079
I always swallow after fellatio and I've
got absolutely no problem with anal sex

40
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,319
480, that would be even better.

41
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,399
A lobster.

42
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,559
As for you, they'll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.

43
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,719
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front crawl, butterfly or backstroke?

44
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,799
If you encounter any problems,
any tensions, any arguing,

45
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,519
(Sounds of birdsong and running water)

46
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,119
for example,
read a work of classic literature

47
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,839
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,

48
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,159
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

49
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,119
We'll talk later.

50
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,439
We'll talk some other time
when it's quieter.

51
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,279
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

52
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,039
We'll talk later.

53
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,439
(Coughs and splutters)

54
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,759
(Spluttering continues)

55
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,279
- Thank you.
- This is our new daughter.

56
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,199
Turn the light on please,
so I can see you better.

57
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,039
Doesn't matter.

58
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,839
These aren't tears, it's just water.
I just washed my face.

59
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,559
that is called the Red Intercourse.

60
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,679
I woke up terrified.

61
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,119
(Laughter)

62
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,159
- Better?
- Yes.

63
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,639
Much better.

64
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,599
My daughter says me
it's a very fine company.

65
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,119
That part about holiday destinations
in the Mediterranean was brilliant.

66
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,919
or red watercolour paint
or something like that.

67
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,919
Who will be able to live
on their own better?

68
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,479
You'd better get out while you still can.

69
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,839
As soon as his last patient left,
I entered his office and I said to him,

70
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,519
That story sounds really interesting
but I have to leave.

71
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,239
I just remembered I left some batteries
next to a tree down there.

72
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,759
Catching a rabbit is difficult,
but I'll try to do better.

73
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,319
Serifos: Greek island located
in the western Cyclades."

74
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,359
If it's better to see clearly
or to be short-sighted? Is that it?

75
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,039
There's no point in lying to you,
you'll find out sooner or later.

76
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,199
Good afternoon.

77
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,079
I can't go much faster.

78
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,039
Can I have a knife and fork, please?
Not a butter knife, a steak knife.
