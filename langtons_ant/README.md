# Langton's ant

In this exercise you will implement the [Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant).

You will practice:

* Writing functions with specific inputs and outputs.
* Working with nested lists.
* Abstraction and representation of concrete states (e.g. ant's direction, cell color).

Furthermore, you will see an example of Python's image processing capabilities.
